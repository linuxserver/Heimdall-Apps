In Traggo there are no tasks, only tagged time spans.\r\n\r\nWith tags, Traggo tries to be as customizable as possible, f.ex. if you work on different projects you could add a project-tag. If you like to see statistics from the different things you do, you could add a type-tag with values like email, programming, meeting. You can do it just as you like.",
