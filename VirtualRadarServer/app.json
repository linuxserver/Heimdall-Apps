    "description": "Virtual Radar Server is an open-source .NET application that runs a local web server. You can connect to the web server with any modern browser and see the aircraft plotted on a map. You will need a radio that is capable of receiving Mode-S transmissions. Virtual Radar Server was written and tested using Kinetic Avionic's SBS-1er and SBS-3 radios but it will work with any receiver or SDR that can produce the Kinetic text message format, Kinetic's SBS-3 binary format, the AVR \"*\", \"@\" or \":\" formats or the Mode-S Beast binary format.",
