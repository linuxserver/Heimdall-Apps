    "description": "AdGuard Home is a network-wide software for blocking ads & tracking. After you set it up, it'll cover ALL your home devices, and you don't need any client-side software for that.\r\n\r\nIt operates as a DNS server that re-routes tracking domains to a \"black hole,\" thus preventing your devices from connecting to those servers. It's based on software we use for our public AdGuard DNS servers -- both share a lot of common code.",
