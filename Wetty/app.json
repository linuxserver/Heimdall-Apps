    "description": "WeTTy = Web + TTy. Terminal web app in browser over http/https. (Ajaxterm/Anyterm alternative, but much better). WeTTy is an alternative to ajaxterm and anyterm but much better than them because WeTTy uses xterm.js which is a full fledged implementation of terminal emulation written entirely in JavaScript. WeTTy uses websockets rather then Ajax and hence better response time.",
